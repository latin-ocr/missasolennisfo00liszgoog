complete negation of the ancient ideal of an ecclesiastica] style—elevated, vague, abstract, dissolving
individual experience into a general mood of supplication and uplift rather than giving voice to any
individual’s rayer.

In this pMass Liszt attempted to attain unity and homogenity of musical expression as it had
not been attained in the musical setting of the Mass before, by the device of community and
transformation of theme—the use of transformed and transfigured versions of one or more melodic
phrases in different connections and contexts. Schumann had already made use of this in several
of his instrumental compositions, and Liszt had greatly developed it in his larger instrumenta] works
——the symphonies, the symphonic poems and the piano concertos. Itis the process that reached its
highest development in the use of leading-motives in Wagner’s later music-dramas.

The listener will find in the “ Gloria ” a phrase that has the effect of a summons, which recurs
in the ‘⁸ Resurrexit '⁹ and in the “ Hosanna,” in the “ Dona Nobis ’' and again at the end. The
chief melodic motive of the “ Christe Eleison '’ makes its reappearance as an important part of the
substance of later sections, as the ‘⁸ Qi Tollis,” the “ Benedictus,’' the “Agnus Dei.'’ There
are other such borrowings.

There has been great debate as to whether or not this is the “ edifying work ‘’ that Liszt
hoped to produce. Upon its first appearance, and after its performances in Gran and those which
speedily followed in other placeS, there was a storm of critical articles and pamphlets that raged
about its merits and defects and its general tendencies—a part of a greater disturbance' ιιι which the
artistic world was involved over the‘ ‘New German’' school of music that was then beginning to
make its way under the leadership of Wagner and Liszt. The specifically musical value of Liszt' s
inspiration was disputed and desended3 the churchliness of his conception questioned and upheld.
This literary dis turbance' is now well-nigh forgotten. One point was the subject of a particularly
obstinate discussion: Is the work in the spirit of Beethoven, or not? Hermann Kretzschmar, in
his interesting analysis, has pointed out how clearly it is the fruit of the influence of Beethoven’s
last period—referring, of course, especially to the great Missa Solennis in D major. This, 100, is
a work that overturned all previous ideals of a churchly style. Its goal is, says Kretzschmar, the
identification of artistic forms and resources with direct natural impressions. The finished work,
developed after a well-laid plan, is, in its fieedom and fiillness of life, to have the effect of an
inspired improvisation. Beethoven never wrought more laboriously than he did upon the Missa
Solennis 3 never tested and filed his results more critically. “ Liszt’s Gran Mass, on the other hand,
is almost literally an improvisation. In the ‘ Gloria’ and ‘ Credo ’ we find passages which are
written with an astonishingly great economy of intellectual expenditure: places in which an insig-
nificant orchestral motive is repeated and transposed without end and without object. It is an al
flesto style that attains its object on a single. hearing, but does not well sustain detailed study.’'
Hanslick accuses Liszt of having set out with the intention of searching the text of the Mass for
the purpose of introducing new intellectual conceptions into it—ideas which the knowledge and
training of his predecessors never suggested to them, and which would not occur to a merely musical
talent, however rich. “ To him the ‘ word ’ isin the highest degree important. With the laborious
zeal of a theologian‚ Liszt translates the hidden meaning of each single word into a corresponding
musical ‘intention ⁹ ”3 and he finds the Mass half opera, half theological treatise.

On the other hand, consider the judgment of Lina Ramann, Liszt’s biographer: “ We feel
ourselves in the Church. ‚No musical declamation contrary to the sense of the text disturbs the
course of our reflections, no sou. 'less formalism cools the warmth of our religious exaltation, but the
truth and depth, the mystica] quality of the expression seizes a mighty hold upon the soul. . .
Liszt’ s genius found the right form to express the many· -sidedness of the text of the Ordinary of the
Mass, notwithstanding the diversity of its character and of the content of its single parts, musically
as an organic whole and as a homogeneous work of art. It is the first Mass ιιι which this end' is

a.ttained '’ Again, listen to a later biographer, M. D. Calvocoressi. · “ Besides being an admirable
monument of a faith all too rare in the nineteenth century, it stupefies us by its sheer musical beauty,
by its structure, by the unity of thought which animates it and by· its logical cohesion, absolute and
perfectly natural* ιιι all its parts. It stupefies still more him who has felt the grandiose power that
animates it from beginning to end.’

Of one thing the listener may be sure in the midst of conflicting opinions that still prevail with
regard to Liszt’ s music: that this Mass‘ is an absolutely faithful reflex of the artistic personality of
its composer3 that‘ it is in the highest degree an embodiment of his musical ideals and aspiratione,
as well as of a religious faith that is peculiarly characteristic of his nature. chnaan Amarea.
