LISZT’S MISSA SOLENNIS
(DIE GRANER MEssE)

RANZ Liszt wrote to Richard Wagner stom Weimar, on March 12, 1855 ε “Ῑ shall have to
work hard for several months to come. The Cardinal Primate of Hungary has set me to the
task of composing a grand Mass for the inauguration of the Cathedral of Gran. The ceremony

will take place in August at the latest. The Emperor will be present, and Ι have undertaken to
conduct the Mass, etc., for which purpose 1 have to be in Gran (three hours’ distance from Pesth)
a month before. The task gives me much pleasure, 3ηά Ι hope to produce an edifying work.”

The work was performed in the Cathedral of Gran, in Hungary, on August 3 1, 1856. Liszt
had thrown himself with the utmost devotion into its composition. He wrote again to Wagner on
May 2 ε’ “ During these last weeks Ι have spun myself into my Mass, and yesterday, at last, 1 got
it done. I do not know how it will sound, but I may say that Ι have prayed it rather than composed it.' ’

Liszt as a boy had desired to enter the Catholic priesthood, so it is said, but was dissuaded
therefrom by his father and his priestly adviser, who perceived the overwhelming claim that music
had on his life. Exalted religious and mystical tendencies, thus signified in his boyhood, persisted
in Liszt’s character through his life. They went through a fiery ordeal in his younger days of
dazzling worldly success; but they were not extinguished. His thoughts were turned strongly
toward the Church before he resigned his post of conductor at the Court of Weimar, in 1861, and
he joined the order of the Franciscans as a Tertiarian, or penitent of the third order, who remain in
the world, but follow a rule or discipline as do the others. His life in Rome, after he had left
Weimar, brought him into still closer relations with the Church. In 1879 he received the tonsure
3ηά an honorary canonry. He wore the priestly garb, though he was never a priest.

This phase of Liszt’s career explains in a certain way his attitude toward ecclesiastical music,
to which he devoted a large part of his creative activity. He approached it with a deep and fervent
piety ς 3ηά the mystical trend of his character found expression not only in his religious compositions,
but also, in a measure, in certain other of his works.

Liszt entered upon this branch of musical art, as he did on the others which he cultivated,
with definite intentioris of accomplishing a reform, and of following the artistic ideals of the new
German school of music, of which he was one of the foremost exponents and champions. It was
hisobject to renew the spirit of liturgical music in the Roman Church. The older ecclesiastica]
compositions of the style that has come to be known by the name of Palestrina—-serene, elevated,
celestially aloof from human passion and striving—had given place to a more or less debased musical
expression, that had much in common with the shallow operatio style of the mid-century, and that,
even in its highest manifestations, had completely forgotten the older spirit. Liszt looked, not
backward to this spirit, but forward to another and a newer one that he conceived to be more in
consonance with the age. In an essay published 33 early as 18 34—he being then twenty-three
years old-he conjured up the vision of a new kind of Church music that should “ unite in colossal
relations the theatre and the Church ς should be at once dramatic and religious, splendid and simple,
solemn and serious, fiery and unrestrained, stormy and tranquil, clear and heartfelt.’' He aspired
to an ecclesiastical musical style that should bring the liturgy of the Church nearer to an intellectual
and emotional expression of the age, should be in closer sympathy with existing artistic ideals as they

were actually manifested in music.
This aspiration it is not difficult to find embodied in Liszt’s church music. How far he went

in it can be seen most clearly from the extreme example of his Hungarian Coronation Mass (com-
posed for the coronation of Francis Joseph as King of Hungary in 1867), in which he uses
Hungarian melodic and harmonic traits and cadences. Yet it should also be said that in his later
years he turned more toward the older and stricter manner.

The Gran Mass· is an endeavor to heighten by musical setting the emotional and ethical
significance of every word and every phrase of the Mass, in the same way as in Wagner's music-
dramas the music heightens the meaning of text and dramatic action in them. Consequently
we find in the Gran Mass an unceasing effort at emotional expressiveness, dramatic effect, delineation
of changing moods, pictorial color, the suggestion of mystery, awe and personal devotion, jubilation,
grief, as the words of the holy office by turns summon them up. In fine, it is a purely subjective
interpretation of the effect the Mass may be supposed to exert, line for line, upon a devoutly earnest
and strongly impressible religious nature, following the sacrament as it is administered. This is a
